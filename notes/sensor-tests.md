Ambient light sensor works well.
Buzzer works well.
RGB lights work well.
BME280 works well.
VEML6040 colour sensing is working well with RGB black and white - has trouble with shiny surfaces though. Best effort.
Button module working with up to 5 buttons (no dip switches, then each dip switch individually)
